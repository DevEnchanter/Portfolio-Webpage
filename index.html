      <h1>Hey I am Min</h1>
      <p>
        A self-taught web developer passionate about creating immersive and user-friendly digital experiences. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have honed my skills through dedicated self-study and completion of a rigorous bootcamp certificate program.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in web development began as a personal interest, but it quickly grew into a full-fledged passion. I have devoted countless hours to mastering the intricacies of front-end development, exploring different frameworks and libraries, and building a diverse range of projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I may not have formal job experience yet, I have gained valuable practical knowledge through my personal projects. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills, experiment with new technologies, and develop a keen eye for design and usability. By continuously pushing myself to learn and improve, I have acquired a solid understanding of responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and code optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take pride in my ability to learn independently and tackle complex challenges. Through self-guided learning, online resources, and participation in coding communities, I have cultivated a strong problem-solving mindset and a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets me apart is my dedication to creating web experiences that not only function flawlessly but also captivate users. I am passionate about delivering intuitive interfaces, seamless interactions, and visually appealing designs. I understand the importance of clean code, maintainability, and adhering to best practices to ensure the highest quality in my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you explore my portfolio, you'll discover a collection of projects that showcase my skills and reflect my creativity. These projects encompass various aspects of web development, including responsive layouts, interactive features, and integration with APIs. I view each project as an opportunity to challenge myself, learn new techniques, and grow as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills, collaborate with others, and contribute to impactful projects. I am open to freelance work, internships, and any chance to gain real-world experience while continuously expanding my knowledge and expertise.
      </p>
